Hey, I'm @Assitan

I have been a software engineer for about 5 years and trained in data science a few years ago.
Also, as a digital arts graduate, I love explaining data science and programming concepts with illustrations.
What drives my days is my passion for code, and especially for helping women develop their skills in tech.
